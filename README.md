# cosmos-apps

_cosmos-apps_ is a collection of applications based on [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) sidechains for the management of energy communities. 
Considering an energy community of N prosumers, the related sidechain is basically deployed on N embedded devices, which constitute the chain nodes.
Each node corresponds to a prosumer and is able to gather data from the related smart meter.
